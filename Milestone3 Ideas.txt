For Project,Member unsure what else to add

#Member - Due to the nature of the member class, unit testing and integration is sufficient.

#Project - 

#In EVENT 
Cases to test all paths of Get Member Names 
# Not sure what naming conventions etc to follow but idea is testing the if/else
#i.e a list with just one entry for the 'if' and then one with multiple for the 'else' 


// Input for 'if' spy ev1
// Input that will use the 'else' spy ev2 
// Coverage for entire 'getMemberNames function 

@Test 
void Test_getMemberName_paths(){
    Event ev1 = spy(new Event("evname", "10/20/2020", "10/22/2020", "descr", "projname"));
    ev1.addMember(new Member("matt","abc@gmail.com")); 
    Event ev2 = spy(new Event("evname", "10/20/2020", "10/22/2020", "descr", "projname"));
    ev2.addMember(new Member("matt","abc@gmail.com"));
    ev2.addMember(new Member("mark","mark@gmail.com"));

    assertEquals("matt",ev1.getMemberNames());
    assertEquals("matt, mark", ev2.getMemberNames()); 

}


// Do we bother testing something like format event? The parameters? 


// For main might have to start stubbing the function apart, cut out the loop and run tests
with hard coded parameters

// What to do to handle all the voids? Stub to where asserts can happen? Need to ensure coverage
somehow
